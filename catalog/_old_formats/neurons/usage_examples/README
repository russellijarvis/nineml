Some NineML neuron files have been added here which were generated by LEMS from NeuroML 2 models.

Note: these are mixtures of AL & UL elements (i.e. components & groups), but could be useful for testing/creating catalog entries.

They are valid according to the Schema at http://neuroml.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/neuroml/DemoVer2.0/lems/Schemas/NineML/NineML_v0.1.xsd,
which is the same as http://svn.incf.org/svn/nineml/trunk/schema/NineML_v0.1.xsd, but the former is used as it is publicly accessible.

The format for the 9ML generated tries to match that as generated by the latest Python libnineml examples
